# Problem 1

- Write an algorithm that takes an array of numbers as an input and calculates the sum of those numbers.
- Define the Time Complexity of that algorithm and determine what the lowest possible time complexity is for this problem.

## Big O Notation

- The lowest Big O Time Complexity for this problem is _O(n)_
- The array is not an arithmetic sequence hence no mathematical formulas can be used to further optimize the code.
- The code solution needs to loop through each item in the input array and add each item value to get the sum.
- Hence, in Big O Time Complexity, the number of operations will take longer as the number of array items increases.
