# Problem 8: Best Sum

- Write a function **_bestSum(targetSum, numbers)_** that takes in a _targetSum_ and an _array of numbers_ as arguments.
- The function should return an _array_ containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the _targetSum_.
- If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.

**Examples:**

```javascript
bestSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]);
/**
 * will return [3, 4], and [7]
 * the return value should be the shortest combination: [7]
 */

bestSum(8, [2, 3, 5]);
/**
 * will return [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], and [3, 5]
 * the return value should be the shortest combination: [3, 5]
 */
```
