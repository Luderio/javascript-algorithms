# Problem 3

- Write an algorithm that takes an array of arithmetic numbers and calculates the sum of those numbers.
- The algorithm must check if the array of number follows an airthmetic pattern.
- Define the Time Complexity of tha algorithm and determin what the lowest possible time complexity is for this problem.
