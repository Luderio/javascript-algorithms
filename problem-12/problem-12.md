# Problem 12: Solve Fibonacci Sequence using Tabulation

- Write a function _fib(n)_ that takes in a number as an argument.
- The function should return the _n-th_ number of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Make sure that the algorithm is optimized to handle larger fibonacci sequences.

**Fibonacci Sequence:**

- The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

**Examples:**

The first few Fibonacci numbers are:

```javascript
// zero-based fibonacci sequence.

n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  8,  9, ...
f = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

**_fib(7)_** should return **_13_** because the fibonacci number at position 7 is 13 from the above example.
