# Problem 7: How Sum

- Write a function **_howSum(targetSum, numbers)_** that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.
- The function should return an array containing any combination of elements that add up to exactly the targetSum.
- If there is no combination that adds up to the targetSum, then return **_null_**.
- If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.

**Example**

```javascript
howSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]); // should return  [3, 4] or [7]

howSum(8, [2, 3, 5]); // should return [2, 2, 2, 2]  or [3, 5]
```
