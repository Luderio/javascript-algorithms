# Problem 5: Grid Traveler

- Say that you are a traveler on a _2D grid_.
- You begin in the _top-left_ corner and your goal is to travel to the _bottom-right_ corner.
- You may only move _down_ or _right_.
- In how many ways can you travel to the goal on the grid with dimensions **_m \* n_**?
- Write a function **_girdTraveler(m, n)_** that satisfies the requirements above.
