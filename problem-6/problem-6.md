# Problem 6: Can Sum

- Write a function **_canSum(targetSum, numbers)_** that takes in a _targetSum_ and an _array of numbers_ as arguments.
- The fuction should return a _boolean value_ indicating wether or not it is possible to generate the _targetSum_ using the _numbers_ from the array.
- You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
- You may assume that all input numbers are non-negative.

**Example:**

```javascript
canSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]); // should return true.
```
